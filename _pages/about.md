Welcome to my personal website. I am Bowen Fang, a [Your Role, e.g., PhD student, researcher] at [Your Institution]. My research focuses on [Your Research Area].

Here you can find information about my publications, projects, and recent activities.

To add your profile picture, please place an image named `prof_pic.jpg` inside the `/assets/img/` directory.

This is placeholder text. Please provide me with more details about yourself to create a more personalized page.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
