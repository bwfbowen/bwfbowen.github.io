I am a Ph.D. student at Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science, where my research focuses on Reinforcement Learning and Autonomous Driving.

I hold an M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University and a B.Mgt in Big Data Management from Peking University. 

This website serves as a central hub for my publications, projects, and professional activities.
