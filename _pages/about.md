I am a Ph.D. student at Columbia University, where I work with Data Science Institute (Smart Cities Center). I develop scalable systems and RL-based agentic reasoning frameworks for stochastic, continuous environments with complex topological constraints. My research interests span reinforcement learning, agentic AI, multimodal reasoning (LLM/VLM), systems resilience, and optimization.

Previously, I interned at AWS AI Labs as an Applied Scientist.

I hold an M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University and a Bachelor in Big Data Management and Applications, minor in Economics from Peking University. 

This website serves as a central hub for my publications, projects, and professional activities.
