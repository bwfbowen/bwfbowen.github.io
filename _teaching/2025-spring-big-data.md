As the Teaching Assistant for Big Data in Transportation (CIEN E4011), I developed and led recitations covering a range of topics essential for handling and analyzing large-scale transportation datasets.

My work included creating and presenting tutorials on:
*   **High-Performance Computing**: Introducing students to JAX for efficient numerical computation, including Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and automatic parallelization with `vmap` and `pmap`.
*   **Cloud Data and APIs**: Demonstrating how to query large public datasets like the NYC Taxi dataset using Google BigQuery and how to leverage the Google Maps API for real-world applications.
*   **Machine Learning Fundamentals**: Building practical examples for both classification (MLP on MNIST) and generative models (fine-tuning a diffusion model on CIFAR-10) using modern frameworks like Flax and Hugging Face Diffusers.
*   **Model Evaluation and Interpretability**: Covering key classification and regression metrics with `scikit-learn` and introducing model explainability techniques using SHAP to help students understand and validate their models.
